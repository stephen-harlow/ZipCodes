One of the aspects that stuck out to me most in the report involved how the state of Texas ranked when it comes to education. The report listed Texas as 2nd in enrollment in public school, but 50th in graduation. I believe a driving force for this severe difference stems from the attitude of some residents in the state. In some of the more rural areas, people are raised to stay where they are, and don't have any dreams to graduate. First and foremost, education should become a larger focus for the state government. Not only in making sure that the material being discussed is high quality, but also, ensuring that the students have outlets in school. If students are provided extra-curricular activities, it may help lead them to new ideas and new goals that they never would have found on there ownI believe that a key insight that the information provides is that this state has a lot of room to improve. With the diverse population and wide-ranging economic support, a small change can cause a drastic change for good.
