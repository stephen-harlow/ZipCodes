# Zip Code Search Tool
This is a basic NodeJS/AngularJS website that allows users to search for Zip Codes in any state in the US. The data is from a variety of sources, and there is no guarantee that it still up to date, at the time of download.
I found this site helpful for Zipcode Parsing. I wrote a simple Python Script to do it: http://www.zipmaps.net/zips/index.htm
